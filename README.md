# MiniMega2560 Project

This is my first project on GitHub so it will appear a little rough until I get up to speed.

This is my build of a Mini Mega2560 board. It uses the Mega2560 cpu with a CP2104 USB interface. The reason that I made this board was I wanted a more ports and memory for Arduino projects and I wanted a Mega2560 that could be used with a breadboard.

The board uses an Atmel mega2560 CPU that can run Arduino (with the correct bootloader installed).
The board can be built as a 3.3 volt 8 MHz or a 5 volt 16 MHz system.
You can use the Arduino Mega2560 bootloader for the 5 volt 16 MHz build, the 3.3 volt 8 MHz system needs to have the fuse set for a External 8 MHz clock, I used MegaCore for that which can be found here on GitHub. It was very easy for me to use.

The board can be found at OSH Park. https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/cue1DDEi with project name MiniMega2560.

I will be adding more build info soon...
